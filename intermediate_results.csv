The solvent-based portion may  include a plurality of solvents.  Background/Summary  CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  [0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.  63/469,992, filed May 31, 2023, and French Patent application Serial No. FR 2308063, filed Jul.  26, 2023, the contents of which are each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  TECHNICAL FIELD  [0002] The present disclosure is drawn to nail compositions, such as UV-curable nail compositions.  BACKGROUND  [0003] Cosmetic nail formulations ideally satisfy numerous consumer needs and desires. For  example, it is often desired for nail formulations to have a target color, be able to be used for an  extended period of time (e.g., a 2-week wear period, where the color does not substantially change  and with high chip resistance), while also being easy to remove. Many features are thought to be  technically incompatible. Formulators end up accepting trade-offs to achieve different goals. For  example, a formulator may need to use an ingredient which may cause irritation, but causes the  formula to last longer on the nails. Such trade-offs are undesirable.  [0004] Thus, what is needed is a safer color coat formulation that can still achieve a long use  period (e.g., 2 weeks of wear), and can be removed relatively easily.  BRIEF SUMMARY  [0005] A cosmetic nail composition may be provided. The cosmetic nail composition may include  an ultraviolet (UV) gel portion and a solvent-based portion. The UV gel portion may include a  plurality of UV-curable materials and a photoinitiator (which may be a type I photoinitiator, such as  ethyl trimethylbenzoyl phenylphosphinate). The plurality of UV-curable materials may be present in  a total amount of at least 19% by weight (such as 19-50%) of the cosmetic nail composition. The  solvent-based portion may include a plurality of solvents.  [0006] The plurality of UV-curable materials may include a difunctional acrylate oligomer. The  difunctional acrylate oligomer may be a urethane monomer, and the plurality of UV-curable  materials may include the urethane monomer (such as a urethane acrylate monomer) and a  polymerizable (meth)acryla","[{'name': 'UV-Curable-Materials', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {'composition': 'cosmetic nail composition', 'percentage': '19%'}}, {'name': 'Photoinitiator', 'label': 'Chemical', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'Difunctional Acrylate Oligomer', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'Polymerizable (meth)acryla', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}]","[{'start': 'UV-Curable-Materials', 'end': 'Photoinitiator', 'type': 'part of', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'Difunctional Acrylate Oligomer', 'end': 'Urethane Monomer', 'type': 'part of', 'properties': {}}]"

","composition may include the UV gel portion, the solvent(s), the  film former(s), the colorant(s), filler(s), UV absorbing agent(s), and pH adjuster(s), and may be  substantially free, essentially free, or free of any other component.  [0095] In various aspects, a method for providing a nail composition with improved wear may be  utilized. The method may include applying a composition as disclosed herein to a nail, and curing  the composition by exposing the composition to an ultraviolet (UV) light. After wearing (e.g., for an  extended period of time), the composition can then be removed from the nail, with less damage to  the nail as compared to conventional long-wear UV gel nail formulations.  EXAMPLES  Example 1  [0096] One embodiment of a nail formulation can be seen in Table 1, below.

The three formulations had 8%, 11%, and 19% UV curable  materials.  [0098] To evaluate the samples, each test formula was painted onto a nail spoon, by applying 2  coats of each formula onto a target nail spoon. Each nail spoon was then cured under an LED UV  light for 30 sec. After curing with the UV light, each nail spoon was aged at room temperature for  24 hours before a removal test.  [0099] The removal test was performed as follows. A cotton pad was saturated with 1 ml of  acetone. The nail spoon was then rubbed in a single direction using the cotton pad, repeatedly,  until the color coat is removed or the acetone in cotton pad is gone. The number of strokes (or  passes) required to remove the color is counted.

As there is almost no  increase in removal resistance from 11% to 15%, the large increase in removal resistance from  15% to 19% is a very surprising benefit.  [0101] Further, additional testing has shown the formulations can provide 2 weeks of wear, with  high shine performance and chip resistance. Additionally, when removing the nail polish, the time  the nails need to be soaked in acetone is greatly reduced as compared to conventional UV gel  formulations—from 10 minutes or more to under 2 minutes.

Extraction,21,"
You are a data scientist working for a company that is building a graph database. Your task is to extract information from data and convert it into a graph database.
Provide a set of Nodes in the form [ENTITY_ID, TYPE, PROPERTIES] and a set of relationships in the form [ENTITY_ID_1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY_ID_2, PROPERTIES].
It is important that the ENTITY_ID_1 and ENTITY_ID_2 exists as nodes with a matching ENTITY_ID. If you can't pair a relationship with a pair of nodes don't add it.
When you find a node or relationship you want to add try to create a generic TYPE for it that  describes the entity you can also think of it as a label.

Some relationships may be duplicated or refer to the same entity. 
Please merge relationships that refer to the same entity.
The datasets contains relationships in the form [ENTITY_ID_1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY_ID_2, PROPERTIES].
You will also be given a set of ENTITY_IDs that are valid.
Some relationships may use ENTITY_IDs that are not in the valid set but refer to a entity in the valid set.
