Background/Summary  CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  [0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.  63/469,992, filed May 31, 2023, and French Patent application Serial No. FR 2308063, filed Jul.  26, 2023, the contents of which are each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  TECHNICAL FIELD  [0002] The present disclosure is drawn to nail compositions, such as UV-curable nail compositions.  BACKGROUND  [0003] Cosmetic nail formulations ideally satisfy numerous consumer needs and desires. For  example, it is often desired for nail formulations to have a target color, be able to be used for an  extended period of time (e.g., a 2-week wear period, where the color does not substantially change  and with high chip resistance), while also being easy to remove. Many features are thought to be  technically incompatible. Formulators end up accepting trade-offs to achieve different goals. For  example, a formulator may need to use an ingredient which may cause irritation, but causes the  formula to last longer on the nails. Such trade-offs are undesirable.  [0004] Thus, what is needed is a safer color coat formulation that can still achieve a long use  period (e.g., 2 weeks of wear), and can be removed relatively easily.  BRIEF SUMMARY  [0005] A cosmetic nail composition may be provided. The cosmetic nail composition may include  an ultraviolet (UV) gel portion and a solvent-based portion.

The plurality of UV-curable materials may be present in  a total amount of at least 19% by weight (such as 19-50%) of the cosmetic nail composition.

[0007] The UV gel portion may be present in a total amount of 19-50% by weight of the cosmetic  nail composition. The photoinitiator may be present in a total amount of 3-6% by weight of the  cosmetic nail composition.  [0008] The solvent-based portion may include at least one film forming agent.

[0095] In various aspects, a method for providing a nail composition with improved wear may be  utilized. The method may include applying a composition as disclosed herein to a nail, and curing  the composition by exposing the composition to an ultraviolet (UV) light. After wearing (e.g., for an  extended period of time), the composition can then be removed from the nail, with less damage to  the nail as compared to conventional long-wear UV gel nail formulations.  EXAMPLES  Example 1  [0096] One embodiment of a nail formulation can be seen in Table 1, below.  TABLE-US-00001 Material Wt % UV Gel Portion 19-30%   UV Curable Materials 15-23%  Difunctional acrylate oligomer 8-15%   Polymerizable (meth)acrylate 2-8% Photoinitiator 2-8%  Solvent-Based Portion 70-81%   Solvents 50-70%   Acetates (Ethyl, Propyl, Butyl) 45-60%   C2-  C5 Monoalcohols (Ethanol, Isopropanol) 3-5% C8-C16 Volatile Hydrocarbon 1-2% Benzoic acid
derivative, citric acid derivative, and/or 3-5% isobutyrate derivative Film Formers 5-20%  Celluloses (Nitrocellulose) 3-10%   Acrylates 1-2% Co-Film Former (Epoxy) 3-10%   Co-Film  Former (Other) <1% Colorant <2% Additional Components (pH Adjusters, Fillers, UV Absorbing  <2% Agents)  Example 2  [0097] Three formulations were made, similar to the formula in Example 1, where the percentage of  UV curable materials was allowed to vary, to be QS'd with acetates, but the formulations were  otherwise identical to each other. The three formulations had 8%, 11%, and 19% UV curable  materials.  [0098] To evaluate the samples, each test formula was painted onto a nail spoon, by applying 2  coats of each formula onto a target nail spoon. Each nail spoon was then cured under an LED UV  light for 30 sec. After curing with the UV light, each nail spoon was aged at room temperature for  24 hours before a removal test.  [0099] The removal test was performed as follows. A cotton pad was saturated with 1 ml of  acetone. The nail spoon was then rubbed in a single direction using the cotton pad, repeatedly,  until the color coat is removed or the acetone in cotton pad is gone. The number of strokes (or  passes) required to remove the color is counted. A higher number of strokes in this removability  test indicates the formulation is more difficult to remove, and the crosslinking density is higher. The  results are shown in Table 2, below.  TABLE-US-00002 Nail Spoon # Wt % of UV Curable Materials Number of strokes req'd 1 19% >70  2 15% 32 3 11% 27 4   8% 20  [0100] The improvement in wear performance when the amount of UV curable materials was at  least 19% by weight of the composition was unexpected and surprising. As there is almost no  increase in removal resistance from 11% to 15%, the large increase in removal resistance from  15% to 19% is a very surprising benefit.  [0101] Further, additional testing has shown the formulations can provide 2 weeks of wear, with  high shine performance and chip resistance. Additionally, when removing the nail polish, the time  the nails need to be soaked in acetone is greatly reduced as compared to conventional UV gel  formulations—from 10 minutes or more to under 2 minutes.  [0102] Various modifications may be made to the various aspects disclosed herein, such  modifications being contemplated as being within the scope of the invention. For example, while a  specific order of steps or arrangement of functional elements is presented in the various  embodiments described herein, various other orders/arrangements of steps or functional elements  may be utilized within the context of the various embodiments. Further, while modifications to  embodiments may be discussed individually, various embodiments may use multiple modifications  contemporaneously or in sequence, compound modifications and the like.  [0103] Although various embodiments which incorporate the teachings of the present invention  have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise many  other varied embodiments that still incorporate these teachings. Thus, while the foregoing is  directed to various embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the  invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof. As such, the appropriate  scope of the invention is to be determined according to the claims.  Claims  1 .
