BACKGROUND Consumers use nail polish to cosmetically enhance the appearance of their nails or protect the nails from the abuses found in their everyday environment. Often this requires a nail polish that is formulated to provide a good shine. Consumers also desire a durable nail polish. Lack of durability is often evidenced by unsightly chipping or peeling of the coating soon after the original coating has been applied, requiring at least in part a reapplication of the coating in an attempt to recreate the aesthetic appearance of the original nail coating.
Durability is often a delicate balance, as coatings that are too soft can scuff and coatings that are too stiff suffer from chipping. A continuing need exists to simultaneously provide both improved gloss and improved durability for nail polish color coats. BRIEF SUMMARY The present invention is directed to a nail polish color coat composition (also referred to herein as “nail color coat composition,” or just “composition”). The nail polish color coat composition includes a solvent system. The solvent system includes at least one vola","[{'name': 'koh', 'label': 'Unit', 'properties': {'type': 'mg/kg', 'description': 'milligrams of KOH per gram'}}, {'name': 'epoxy resin', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'colorant', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'acrylic copolymer', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {'acid value': 160, 'description': 'copolimer acid value range'}}, {'name': 'Tosylamide/Epoxy resin', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'ethyl acetate', 'label': 'Solvent', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'butyl acetate', 'label': 'Solvent', 'properties': {}}, {'name': 'nitrocellulose', 'label': 'Material', 'properties': {}}]","[{'start': 'koh', 'end': 'epoxy resin', 'type': 'contains', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'acrylic copolymer', 'end': 'koh', 'type': 'has acid value', 'properties': {'value_range': '160-170'}}, {'start': 'solvents', 'end': 'ethyl acetate', 'type': 'contains', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'solvents', 'end': 'butyl acetate', 'type': 'contains', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'nail polish color coat composition', 'end': 'acrylic copolymer', 'type': 'includes', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'nail polish color coat composition', 'end': 'Tosylamide/Epoxy resin', 'type': 'includes', 'properties': {}}, {'start': 'nail polish color coat composition', 'end': 'nitrocellulose', 'type': 'includes', 'properties': {}}]"

","r having an acid value of 0 mg KOH per gram [Example C1]. A test solution of each of the materials above was prepared by dissolving various materials to a concentration by weight in ethyl acetate of 40% (except for Example C1, which was 50% active). The test solutions were evaluated using a conical mandrel test, ASTM test D522-93a (2008), “Standard Test Methods for Mandrel Bend Test of Attached Organic Coatings.” Cold-rolled steel test strips are used as substrates (22 gauge, 0.8 mm thick), preferably 100 mm×150 mm long/wide. The strips are cleaned such as with volatile solvent, to remove residual oil. Uniform coatings are applied to the test strips and allow them to air dry. The coated dried samples are conditioned for at least about 2 hrs. and 50% relative humidity. A conical mandrel tester having a smooth steel 200 ml long cone with a diameter of 3 mm at one end and 38 mm at the other end is employed. With the operating lever of the apparatus in a horizontal position, the test specimen is slipped between the mandrel and the drawbar with the finish side towards the drawbar. The specimen is rigidly clamped in a vertical position adjacent to the mandrel by placing the long edge behind the clamping bar in such a manner that the panel is always set up to the narrow end of the mandrel. The lever is moved through about 180° at uniform velocity to bend the specimen approximately 135°. To determine crack resistance under more simulated use conditions, the bend time should be about 1 s. The bent surface of the specimen is examined immediately with the unaided eye for cracking. The results of the test indicated that; Example E2 and Example E3 showed minimal cracking after day 1. Example E1 showed some cracking after day 1; Example C1 showed some cracking and additionally showed significant buckling after day 1. Example 2: Hardness for Nail Color Coat Compositions Compositions were prepared to evaluate the hardness of color coat compositions.

(4) composition comprising an acrylic copolymer having an acid value 0 mg KOH per gram and epoxy resin. [Example C2] Sample Preparation Samples were prepared by combining solvents, nitrocellulose, acrylic polymer, epoxy resin and other plasticizers, other film- forming polymers and other ingredients in a jar. The blend was allowed to let sit 12 to 24 hours. It was then mixed for three minutes with overhead mixer until uniform. The samples were then allowed to sit for 24 hours before testing so any air bubbles would dissipate. The test nail color coat compositions were evaluated by measuring hardness at room temperature. Test Description To perform the test, a 5×4-inch glass plate and a 6 mil Bird applicator are thoroughly cleaned with acetone and wiped KLEENEX tissue until dry. The glass plate is placed in the center of an automatic draw down machine of a Erichsen Dry Time Apparatus. The speed of the drawdown machine is set for 25 mm/sec. The Bird Applicator is set on the glass plate and flush against the moving bar. Three ml of test composition is placed across the width of the glass plate. The glass place is held, and the start button is pressed on the drawdown machine to form a homogeneous film across the length of the plate without moving the position on the plate. The film is drawn down using the 6 mil Bird Applicator. The drawdown bar is reset, and residue is cleaned from glass plate and drawdown machine with acetone. The film is allowed to dry about 24 hours (1 day) and initial hardness reading is taken. Additional measurements are taken at 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after initial draw down.

Example 3: Adhesion for Nail Color Coat Compositions Compositions were prepared to evaluate the adhesion of color coat compositions. Specifically, the following color coat compositions were evaluated: (1) composition comprising different levels of an acrylic copolymer having an acid value between 130 mg KOH per gram and 150 mg KOH per gram and epoxy resin [Example E7.1, E7.2, E7.5, described above]; (2) composition comprising different levels of an acrylic copolymer having an acid value between 145 mg KOH per gram and 165 mg KOH per gram and epoxy resin [Example E8.1, E8.2, E8.5, described above]; (3) composition comprising different levels of an acrylic copolymer having an acid value between 160 mg KOH per gram and 170 mg KOH per gram and epoxy resin [Example E9. 1, E9.2, E9.5, described above]. Sample Preparation Samples were prepared by combining solvents, nitrocellulose, acrylic polymer, epoxy resin and other plasticizers, other film- forming polymers and other ingredients in a jar. The blend was allowed to let sit 12 to 24 hours. It was then mixed for three minutes with overhead mixer until uniform. The samples were then allowed to sit for 24 hours before testing. The nail polish film is drawn down using the 6-mil bird applicator on vitro nail substrate. The vitro nail samples were then allowed to sit for 24 hours before testing. The test nail color coat compositions were evaluated by measuring adhesion. Test Description To perform the test, a vitro nail substrate and a 6-mil bird applicator are thoroughly cleaned with acetone and wiped KLEENEX tissue until dry. The nail polish film is drawn down using the 6- mil bird applicator on vitro nail substrate. The samples were then allowed to sit for 24 hours before testing. The test samples were evaluated using ASTM D3359 “Standard test method for measuring adhesion by tape test”. A cross hatch tool is used to scrape the film on the vitro nail. The substrate is then rotated 90 degrees and scraped again. A piece of tape is applied on top of the scraped area and lifted. Amount of product remaining is evaluated for adhesion.
