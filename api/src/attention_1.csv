"0024] The water-soluble sunscreens for inclusion in the composition of the present invention are generally commercially available in the acid form. When included in the composition in the acid form (pre neutralized forms) i.e having sulphonic acid group (â€”SO.sub.3H) the composition additionally comprises a neutralising agent to convert the acid form in to the salt form, in which form it is known to be active as a sunscreen with an exception to Mexoryl SX which can act as sunscreen with and without neutralization. When included, the neutralising agent is preferably in 0.05% to 4% by weight of the composition. The neutralising agent is preferably an inorganic or an organic alkali. Organic alkali is preferably an amine such as triethanol amine or diethanol amine. The present inventors have observed that the inorganic alkali is especially preferred. Preferred are alkali metal hydroxides. Most preferred metal hydroxide for inclusion as neutralising agent in the composition of the invention are sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.[0025] Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that due to the specific nature of the water soluble sunscreens having absorption maxima between 330 nm and 370 nm, like its unique chemical structure, absorbance and relative solubility, which determines their partition between rinse away water and cleansing surface resulting in higher sunscreen deposition thereby resulting in enhanced UV protection benefits. [0026] The composition of the present invention provides UV protection which is higher than 30%, preferably higher than 35%, more preferably higher than 40%, even more preferably higher than 45%. [0027] The composition of the invention comprises a surfactant which aids in the cleaning action. To enable cleaning, surfactant is included in 3 to 80% preferably 6 to 80%, further more preferably 10 to 75% by weight of the composition. Skin Cleansing Compositions    [0028] The composition of the invention is especially one which is used to cleanse the skin. It generally contains high amount of surfactant. The surfactant is preferably an anionic surfactant e.g. an alkyl sulphate and/or ethoxylated alkyl sulfate surfactant. These anionic surfactants are preferably present at a level of from 1 to 20%, preferably 2 to 16%, further more preferably from 3 to 16% by weight of the composition. Preferred alkyl sulfates are C8-18 alky sulfates, more preferably C12-18 alkyl sulfates, preferably in the form of a salt with a solubilising cation such as sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium. Preferred alkyl ether sulfates are those having the formula: RO(CH.sub.2CH.sub.2O).sub.nSO.sub.3M; wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl having from 8 to 18 (preferably 12 to 18) carbon atoms; n is a number having an average value of greater than at least 0.5, preferably between 1 and 3, more preferably between 2 and 3; and M is a solubilising cation such as sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium. An example is sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES). SLES having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 0.5 to 3, preferably 1 to 3 is especially preferred. The composition may comprise one or more further anionic cleansing surfactants which are cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application. [0029] The composition of the invention preferably additionally comprises an amphoteric surfactant preferably a betaine surfactant preferably an alkyl amidopropyl betaine surfactant for example cocamidopropyl betaine CAPB). In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises from 0.1 to10 wt. %, preferably from 0.5 to 8 wt. %, more preferably from 1 to 5 wt. % of a betaine surfactant","Functional Role: Sunscreen
